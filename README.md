# ChickenDetector-MaskRCNN-Pytorch
## **Motivation:**
I have to count all the chickens every day to check if they are all in the hencoop. As it's hard to count them in the nest, I decided to count them using CV. I will be placing the camera above the door, thus most of the photos are taken from an overhead angle.

You can find the annotation file, named `_annotations.coco.json`, in the train folder.
